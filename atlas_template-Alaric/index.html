    <h1>Avery The Alien</h1>
   
    
    <h3> Scientific Name</h3>
    <p> Avery Vesta</p>
    <h3> Discovered by/ at</h3>
    <p> March 10, 2124: "Avery", the first extraterrestrial life form encountered by humanity, 
        was discovered by Dr. Nelson Avery Julius, during the fourth mining expedition to 
        asteroid "4 Vesta", one of the largest and brightest asteroids in our solar system. 
        His first words upon encountering this organism were : "Ouucchh my fingers owwiee".</p>
    <h3>Family</h3>
    <p> As this organism is unrelated to anything on earth, 
        Avery has been categorized as part of the family "Vesta"; a new taxonomic family, named after the asteroid where he was first discovered.

    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Habitat</h3>
    <p> This organism was first discovered on asteroid 4 Vesta, during the fourth Asteroid mining expedition of the CosMcDonalad's corporation. 
        It appears that this creature is most comfortable hiding in the nooks within the asteroid's outer crust.
         It seems the extraction of vauable minerals and the constant use of powertools on 4 Vesta must have agitated it somehow. It is imperitave that we discover a way to communicate with Avery, so that we can inform it that its illegally living on the property of the CosMcDonald's corporation.</p>
    <h3>Appearance</h3>
    <p>The organism seems to be comprised of a mass of girating and colorful veins/tubes, with a central orifice that it uses 
        to consume various objects, mostly the fingers of the workers on  asteroid 4 Vesta. The organism also has four dark red eyes and two eyebrows. </p>
    <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The organism continually rotates its body through space, advancing towards its prey </li>
        <li>seems to be incredibly agitated and hungry. </li>
    </ul>

            <span class="red">What we know so far about Avery?</span>
            As of right now, we know very little about Avery. We can visually observe that he appears to have four eyes, all a shade of dark red. 
            His body looks to be a mass of multicolored veins, centered around an orifice which appears to be a mouth. We are not able to discern his cognitive abilities currently, 
            as most researchers havent been able to observe him for long without losing a few fingers.
            <br>
            <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with Avery</span> Every researcher that has studied avery so far has lost multiple digits on their hand. As there are no lengths Avery will not go when it is hungry, every researcher must keep their hands closed while directly observing it, as to preserve as many fingers as possible.
